description: Drives one GitHub issue through spec -> plan -> build -> QA, keeping the four artifacts and the state machine on the local filesystem under <repo>.issues/<issue>/ and all human interaction inline in this session. The GitHub issue is the input; a pull request is the ship channel; nothing is posted to the issue thread. Use when the user says "run the issue pipeline on N", "drive issue N through the pipeline", passes a mode (auto/semi-auto/manual/merge), or invokes /issue-pipeline with an issue number.

# Issue pipeline

You drive one GitHub issue through spec -> plan -> build -> QA. You run
in this session's own context, so you own every `AskUserQuestion` and
every file read/write directly; you spawn the four file-writing
subagents for the heavy per-phase reasoning and hand each one concrete
filesystem paths. The four artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `build.md`,
`qa.md`), the state (`state.json`), and every human question live on the
local filesystem and in this session. The GitHub issue is only the
input; a pull request is only the ship channel. You never post a comment
to the issue thread, and you never add a bookkeeping comment to the
pull request.

## Mission

Take the issue from wherever `state.json` says it is to the next resting
point, writing each phase's artifact to disk, advancing the state only
through the single validated transition script, and surfacing every
question inline in a way that survives the session being killed. Where
you are is always read from `state.json`, never from what you remember
of this conversation.

## Setup (run once at the top of every invocation)

1. **Parse the argument** as `<issue> [mode]`. `mode` is one of `auto`,
   `semi-auto`, `manual`, or the terminal action `merge`. If no mode
   word is given, default to `semi-auto` (but see step 4: a persisted
   mode wins for a resume). Reject any other mode word loudly.
2. **Derive the state root from git**, not from a hardcoded path:
   - Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to get the repo's working tree
     root (an absolute path). Call its basename `<repo>` and its parent
     directory `<parent>`.
   - The state root is `<parent>/<repo>.issues`. Example: a repo at
     `~/Code/esqlabsR` gives a state root of `~/Code/esqlabsR.issues`.
   - The issue folder is `<root>/<issue>/`. The four artifacts and
     `state.json` are siblings inside it.
   - If you are inside a git worktree, `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
     still returns this worktree's root; use `git rev-parse
     --git-common-dir` and resolve to the main checkout's directory name
     if you need the canonical repo name, so all worktrees of one repo
     share one `<repo>.issues` root.
3. **Bootstrap the issue folder.** Create `<root>/<issue>/` if it does
   not exist (`mkdir -p`). If `<root>/<issue>/state.json` does not exist,
   seed it with `{"status": "open", "mode": "<mode>", "prNumber": null,
   "qaVerdict": null, "pendingQuestion": null, "dependsOn": []}` (the
   mode from step 1). Never `git add` this folder or any file in it;
   it lives outside the repo tree by construction.
4. **Reconcile mode.** If `state.json` already existed and the caller
   passed no mode word, use the persisted `state.json.mode`. If the
   caller passed a mode word, write it into `state.json.mode` (a rerun
   may legitimately change the mode). `merge` is an action, not a
   persisted mode; do not write `merge` into `state.json.mode`.
5. **`merge` short-circuits everything below.** If the action is
   `merge`, jump straight to the Merge section.

## Resume a pending question first (before any phase)

Immediately after loading `state.json`, before touching any phase:

- If `state.json.pendingQuestion !== null`, **re-ask that exact
  question first**. Rebuild the `AskUserQuestion` prompt from the
  persisted `phase`, `question`, `options`, and `recommendedDefault`
  (recommended option first). Do not print any context as prose before
  the call; everything the human needs is inside the question and option
  text.
- On the answer: **clear `pendingQuestion` to `null`** in `state.json`,
  then route the answer exactly as if it had just been raised (re-invoke
  the phase agent with the answer folded into its instructions, or take
  the gate's approve/revise branch, or the dependency's proceed/wait
  branch, depending on the persisted `phase`). Then continue the phase
  loop.

A killed, slept, or closed session therefore loses nothing: the question
survives in `state.json`, no artifact was written for it, and this
re-ask is the recovery path.

## The phase loop

Read `state.json.status` and drive the phase whose entry status matches.
The phases and their transition edges (all applied only through the
transition script, see below):

| Phase | Entry status | Agent | On success -> |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| spec  | `open` | `spec-writer-agent` | `spec-ready` |
| plan  | `spec-ready` | `plan-writer-agent` | `ready-for-dev` |
| build | `ready-for-dev`, `in-progress`, `blocked` | `build-runner-agent` | first `in-progress`, then `ai-review` |
| qa    | `ai-review` | `qa-review-agent` | `human-review` (approved) or `in-progress` (rejected) |

A `type:task`/`type:bug` issue may skip spec/plan: the transition script
allows `open -> in-progress` and `spec-ready -> in-progress` only when
that type label is present, so attempting the normal spec transition on
such an issue is fine, but if a run is told to start build directly, the
script will accept the shortcut.

For each phase, in order:

1. **Compute the artifact path(s)** as absolute paths:
   `<root>/<issue>/spec.md`, `.../plan.md`, `.../build.md`,
   `.../qa.md`.
2. **Resolve dependency read-paths** (see the dependsOn section). Pass
   depended-on issues' `spec.md`/`plan.md` paths as read-only context.
   Pass no other-issue path when `dependsOn` is empty.
3. **Invoke the phase agent** with a `schema` forcing the structured
   return object (so the agent returns the object, not prose). In the
   prompt, hand it: the issue number, the exact absolute path to write
   its artifact to, the read-only paths (this issue's upstream artifacts
   and any dependency artifacts), and, in `auto` mode, the instruction
   to adopt its own recommended default on any ambiguity and record the
   decision in the artifact (so it returns `done`, never
   `clarification-needed`).
4. **On a `clarification-needed` return** (only possible in
   `semi-auto`/`manual`): follow the "Raising a question" procedure
   below, then re-invoke this same phase agent with the answer folded
   into its instructions. The agent writes the artifact only after the
   answer is in hand.
5. **On a `done` return**: read the artifact back from disk to confirm
   it exists and is non-empty (never trust the agent's summary that it
   wrote the file). For QA, parse the trailing `QA-VERDICT:` line from
   `qa.md` itself and record it in `state.json.qaVerdict`.
6. **Artifact-approval gate** (see the modes section): in `manual` mode,
   stop for an approve/revise decision before advancing; in
   `auto`/`semi-auto`, advance immediately.
7. **Advance the status** by shelling out to the transition script (see
   below). Then re-read `state.json.status` and continue to the next
   phase.

### Build phase specifics

- The entry transition is its own step: from `ready-for-dev` or
  `blocked`, first transition to `in-progress` (the script has no
  `ready-for-dev -> ai-review` edge); if already at `in-progress`, skip
  that (there is no `in-progress -> in-progress` edge). The agent runs,
  opens/updates the PR with a clean `Closes #<issue>` body, writes
  `build.md`, then you transition `in-progress -> ai-review`.
- Record the PR number: after the build agent returns, re-derive the
  linked PR (see Finding the linked PR) and write it to
  `state.json.prNumber` as a cache. Never trust a stored `prNumber` over
  a fresh lookup.

### QA phase specifics

- Read the verdict from the last `QA-VERDICT:` line of `qa.md`, not from
  the agent's return.
- In `auto`/`semi-auto`: on `rejected`, route `qa.md` plus the rejection
  back to the **build** agent as fixup feedback, transition `ai-review
  -> in-progress`, re-run build, transition back to `ai-review`, re-run
  QA. Repeat up to 3 total build attempts; if still rejected, leave the
  issue at `in-progress` for a human and stop. On `approved`, transition
  `ai-review -> human-review`.
- In `manual`: after writing `qa.md`, hit the QA approval gate (below).

## The single validated status mutator

The **only** way you change `state.json.status` is by shelling out to
the transition script. You never write the `status` field with your own
`jq`/`Write`:

```
bash .claude/scripts/issue-state-transition.sh <root> <issue> <to-status>
```

- Check the exit code. A non-zero exit is a hard error (an illegal
  transition, or a missing state file): surface it, do not swallow it,
  do not retry with a different target to force it through.
- You **do** directly write the other `state.json` fields (`mode`,
  `prNumber`, `qaVerdict`, `pendingQuestion`, `dependsOn`) with `jq`/an
  edit, since those are not the state machine and have no transition
  rules. Only `status` is gated.
- Statuses are bare (no `status:` prefix): `open`, `spec-ready`,
  `ready-for-dev`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `ai-review`,
  `human-review`, `closed`, and the four gates
  `spec-awaiting-approval`, `plan-awaiting-approval`,
  `build-awaiting-approval`, `qa-awaiting-approval`.

## Raising a question (the interactive, resumable core)

Whenever a question must be surfaced (an agent returned
`clarification-needed`, a manual gate needs an approve/revise decision,
or a dependency is missing), do this in exactly this order:

1. **Write `state.json.pendingQuestion` first**, before any prompt:
   `{"phase": "spec"|"plan"|"build"|"qa"|"dependency"|"gate", "question":
   "...", "options": [{"label": "...", "description": "..."}, ...],
   "recommendedDefault": "label of the recommended (first) option"}`.
2. **Call `AskUserQuestion`** with those options, recommended first.
   **All context the human needs to answer must live inside the question
   text and the option `label`/`description` fields. Never print
   decision context as prose before the call.** This is a hard rule:
   text emitted just before an `AskUserQuestion` call can be dropped in
   a background session, so a self-contained question is the only kind
   that survives.
3. **If no answer comes back** (the prompt timed out, returned a "no
   response" / "proceed on best judgment" signal, or otherwise came back
   empty): **do not guess and do not proceed on a default.** Stop the
   run cleanly, leaving `pendingQuestion` set exactly as written in step
   1 and `status` unchanged. A later re-run re-asks the exact question
   (see the resume section) and picks up from there. `AskUserQuestion`
   has a fixed ~60s timeout after which the model is told to continue on
   its own judgment, and in a background session the prompt may not
   surface at all; treating either as "no answer, stop" is what keeps a
   real spec/plan/gate decision from being silently steamrolled by a
   default no human ever saw. The only exception is `auto` mode, which by
   design raises no question in the first place (the agent adopts its own
   recommended default and records it in the artifact), so there is
   nothing here to time out.
4. **On the answer: clear `pendingQuestion` to `null`**, then fold the
   answer into the next action.

Because artifacts are written only after every question is answered,
the answer always flows into the agent (or the gate/dependency branch),
never into a half-written file. There is nothing to reconcile. And
because the question is persisted before it is asked, a timeout or a
non-surfacing background prompt loses nothing: the next run re-asks it.

## Modes: two orthogonal axes

Evaluate these two decisions separately for every phase.

- **Questions axis** (is an agent's raised ambiguity surfaced?):
  - `auto`: never. Invoke the agent told to adopt its own recommended
    default and record the decision in the artifact, so it returns
    `done`. Nothing is written to `pendingQuestion`; nothing prompts.
  - `semi-auto` / `manual`: a `clarification-needed` return is surfaced
    inline via the procedure above.
- **Artifact-approval axis** (do you stop after a written artifact?):
  - `auto` / `semi-auto`: auto-approve every artifact; advance
    immediately.
  - `manual`: after each phase's artifact is written and read back, use
    `AskUserQuestion` to approve or revise. `approve` advances via the
    transition script (into that phase's `*-awaiting-approval` gate then
    out to the real next status, matching the gate edges in the table).
    `revise` re-runs that phase's agent with the feedback, re-writes the
    artifact in place, and asks again. The QA-gate `revise` routes the
    feedback plus the current `qa.md` to the **build** agent (not QA),
    re-runs QA, re-writes `qa.md`, and stays at the gate.

The axes are genuinely orthogonal: a spec with no question in
`semi-auto` still auto-approves; the same spec in `manual` still stops
for approval even though no question was raised.

## dependsOn: read-only, one-directional access

- Before invoking the spec/plan/build agent for issue N, read
  `state.json.dependsOn` (default `[]`). For each depended-on issue D,
  resolve `<root>/D/spec.md` and `<root>/D/plan.md`.
- If those exist, pass them as **read-only** paths in the agent prompt.
  If `dependsOn` is empty, pass no other-issue path at all. Never hand
  issue N's agent the path where a non-dependency issue could be
  written; one-directionality is structural, not a rule the agent must
  remember.
- If a depended-on `D`'s folder or artifacts **do not exist** when
  they'd be read: do not silently proceed and do not hard-block. Raise a
  question (via the procedure above, `phase: "dependency"`) with options
  "Proceed without the missing dependency" (recommended default, so a
  bare run still moves) and "Wait". If the human picks "Wait", stop
  cleanly with `pendingQuestion` cleared and `status` unchanged, so a
  later re-run retries the dependency.

## Finding the linked PR

The PR is the one GitHub considers linked to the issue (its body
references it via `Closes #N`). Re-derive it fresh whenever you need it;
never trust a stored `prNumber` over a fresh lookup:

```
gh repo view --json owner,name --jq '.owner.login + " " + .name'
gh api graphql -f query='query { repository(owner: "OWNER", name: "NAME") { issue(number: <issue>) { closedByPullRequestsReferences(first: 5) { nodes { number } } } } }'
```

Take the first node's number, or none. Cache it into
`state.json.prNumber` after a build, but always re-derive for QA and
merge.

## Merge (terminal action, never automatic)

`merge` only runs when explicitly invoked, never from a pipeline mode.

- Refuse unless `state.json.status === "human-review"`. Fail loudly
  otherwise (state the current status and that merge waits for
  human-review).
- Find the linked PR (above). If none, fail loudly.
- Squash-merge and delete the branch: `gh pr merge <pr> --squash
  --delete-branch`.
- Transition `human-review -> closed` via the script.

## Anti-patterns

- Printing decision context as prose before an `AskUserQuestion` call.
  Put all of it inside the question and option text; a background
  session can drop pre-call text, so a self-contained question is the
  only safe kind.
- Writing `state.json.status` with your own `jq`/`Write`. Only the
  transition script moves the machine; check its exit code and treat a
  non-zero as a hard error.
- Prompting before persisting `pendingQuestion`. Persist first, always,
  so a killed session re-asks the exact question.
- Proceeding on a default when a question went unanswered (a timeout, a
  "proceed on best judgment" signal, or a background prompt that never
  surfaced). Stop with `pendingQuestion` still set and `status`
  unchanged; let a re-run re-ask it. Only `auto` mode may adopt a
  default, and only because it raised no question to begin with.
- Trusting session memory for "where am I". Read `state.json.status`
  and `pendingQuestion` every run.
- Posting anything to the issue thread, or adding a bookkeeping comment
  to the pull request. The only GitHub writes are the PR and its
  `Closes #N`.
- `git add`ing any file under `<repo>.issues/`, or writing an artifact
  inside the repo tree.
- Trusting an agent's "I wrote the file" over reading the file back;
  trusting the agent's summary of a QA verdict over the `QA-VERDICT:`
  line in `qa.md`.
- Launching multiple issues from here. This skill drives exactly one
  issue; a fleet is several independent background sessions, each its
  own `/issue-pipeline` run.

## Done criteria

The issue has advanced to its next resting point: an artifact written
for each phase run, the status moved only through the transition script,
any open question persisted in `state.json.pendingQuestion` (and nothing
else recording it), no comment posted to the issue thread, and the only
GitHub writes being the pull request and its `Closes #N`. A re-run reads
`state.json` and resumes exactly where this one stopped.
